# webpage-update-discord-bot
This is a very simple discord bot that notifies you when the content of a web page changes.

Depends on discord.py

In the config you can set the targets and the seconds between checks as shown.
The CHANNELID is the one of the channel where you want updates to be sent

The BOTTOKEN should be stored in an env -> but you can change that if you want.
